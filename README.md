#### File Handling

- The application can handle various file types (PDFs, DOCX, TXT, etc.) that are uploaded by users. It processes these files through the appropriate agents to extract data or perform actions based on the file content (like processing contracts or analyzing insurance claims).
- Some agents require users to upload files, and the system will save these files, process them, and delete them when done.

#### PDF Merging

- For tasks involving multiple PDFs, the system can merge them into a single document to simplify analysis and processing.



## How It Works: Step-by-Step Process
### User Login/Registration

Users create an account with the system, or log in if they already have one.
Once logged in, they receive an access token that lets them use the system's features securely.
### Using Agents to Process Data

Once logged in, users can use various agents to perform tasks. For example:
A user might upload a contract, and the Contract Summarizer Agent will analyze it and provide a summary.
A user could upload customer feedback, and the Customer Sentiment Agent will classify it as positive or negative.
A user might upload marketing materials, and the Marketing Agent will help create new posts.
### Files & Data Management

Users upload files (such as PDFs or Word documents) for processing. The system saves the files temporarily, processes them using the relevant agent, and then deletes them when finished.
For tasks involving multiple PDFs, the system can merge these into a single document for easier handling.
### Virtual Assistants and Chatbots

The system offers AI-powered assistants and chatbots. For example, the Virtual Assistant or Onboarding Chatbot can interact with users, answer questions, and provide helpful guidance based on documents uploaded to the system.
### Real-Time Processing

The system processes tasks in real-time using Python's asynchronous programming. This ensures the application can handle many requests at once without slowing down.
